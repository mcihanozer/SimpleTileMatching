# SimpleTileMatching

A simple Bejeweled clone that I wrote from scratch while learning how to work with Cocos2d-x.

Some notes:
<ul>
	<li>All possible junctions (T and L) are supported.</li>
	<li>A fake physics is created.</li>
	<li>Adaptable for different grid size, grid size can be changed from the user interface</li>
	<li>Since it is my very first time with Cocos2d-x, it is more like a prototype. So, it has some design pattern lacks and memory usage might be poor.</li>
</ul>
